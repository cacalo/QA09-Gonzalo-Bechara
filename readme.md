# QA09: Form checking excercise - by Gonzalo Bechara
This excercise is comprised by two HTML files with webpages, two CSS for style and a few .js files with some functionality.
The objective is to test that each site has the right components in it.

## Project .js composition
I separated the functionality of the tests in 2 differnt files:
* **alertBox.js**: Holds the functionality that display different error or success messages on the html page.
* **tests.js**: Holds the engine for the tests to occur.
* **login.js / register.js**: Call the tests each site is designed to do.
